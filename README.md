Car racing game  
Copyright © 2024 Güneş Balcı

I used allegro 5 library.

This was my first attempt of making a game. This project was given to me as a project homework of Programming Laboratory II course. 

I am aware that folder layout is awful.

I didn't work with git at that time and now i decided to add it.
